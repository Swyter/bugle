    <h1>BuGLe News</h1>
    <h2>Build fixes for Debian users (06/03/2006)</h2>
    <p>
    James Lyon has submitted a small patch needed to get BuGLe to compile on
    Debian testing. I've incorporated it into the new release, 0.0.20060306.
    Note that this release contains only build fixes and if you were able
    to compile 0.0.20060224 then there is no reason to use this release.
    </p>
    <h2>gl2ps integrated as a filter-set (24/02/2006)</h2>
    <p>
    Today's release incorporates <a href="http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/">gl2ps</a>
    into a filter-set, allowing you to capture your scene as Postscript, EPS,
    PDF or SVG. The gl2ps mechanism itself has some limitations, and hence
    will not work with advanced applications that use per-pixel operations,
    but it does work with glxgears (if your browser supports SVG, click
    <a href="images/glxgears.svg" type="image/svg+xml">here</a> to see it).
    </p>
    <p>
    The snapshots are made possible by another new feature, keyboard
    interception. The screenshot filter-set also takes a key to trigger the
    screenshot, and some filter-sets (such as wireframe and video capture)
    can be enabled or disabled on the fly by keypress.
    </p>
    <p>
    As usual, there are also some miscellaneous bugfixes (see the ChangeLog
    for details), this time mostly affecting GTK+ 2.8.
    </p>
    <h2>Improved texture viewer and ATI driver support (1/1/2006)</h2>
    <p>
    I've worked on the texture viewer in the debugger and made it a lot 
    better. It is not yet complete (in particular 3D textures cannot be
    viewed, and luminance textures show up red), but should be an improvement
    on the previous release.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'd be interested to hear what features people would be interested in
    seeing in the texture viewer, and in fact gldb in general.
    </p>
    <p>I also spent a few days over Christmas with only my laptop, which has
    an ATI graphics card. I found some surprising bugs in the ATI driver
    (for example, during <tt>glDrawArrays</tt> the colour set with
    <tt>glColor3f</tt> is simply ignored), but also some bugs in my own
    code that only showed up with the ATI drivers. So those of you with
    ATI cards should now get a much better experience from BuGLe.
    </p>
    <h2>New release (0.0.20051112) adds preliminary GUI debugger (12/11/2005)</h2>
    <p>
    The promised GUI debugger is now ready in a preliminary form (meaning that
    lots of things aren't supported yet, but it shouldn't break). There are also
    several new extensions supported (see the changelog).
    </p>
    <h2>Patch against 0.0.20050512 (18/5/2005)</h2>
    <p>
    Luca Cappa has been very helpful pointing out bugs. <a href="downloads/bugle-0.0.20050512-patch-luca1">This patch</a>
    should fix a number of compile-time problems. After applying it, be sure to
    rerun <tt>configure</tt> and do a <tt>make clean</tt>.
    </p>
    <h2>New release fixes build error (12/5/2005)</h2>
    <p>
    I've just released a new version <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bugle/bugle-0.0.20050512.tar.bz2?download">(0.0.20050512)</a> that fixes the build problem listed in the previous post. It also fixes a few bugs and adds some new extensions to the state dump in gldb, so it is worth installing even if the previous release compiled for you.
    </p>
    <h2>Read this if you have a build error (11/5/2005)</h2>
    <p>Several people have emailed me to ask about build errors like the following:
    </p>
<pre>
filters/stats.c: In function `initialise_stats':                                
filters/stats.c:408: error: `GROUP_glBeginQueryARB' undeclared (first

</pre>
    <p>
    The short answer is yes, I messed up. I'll make a bugfix release soon, but in
    meantime here are two workarounds you can try.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Update your <tt>glext.h</tt>. You can download the latest one from SGI
        <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/ABI/glext.h">here</a>. The file normally lives in /usr/include/GL/glext.h, although your OS may do something different. If you're not the sysadmin on your machine, you can put the downloaded file in a <tt>GL</tt> subdirectory of the bugle tree. Upgrading <tt>glext.h</tt>
        is a good idea anyway, since it will enable extra features of bugle.</li>
        <li>Repair the code. Either just remove the two offending lines, or else
        surround the enclosing <tt>if</tt> statement with the lines
        <kbd>#ifdef GL_ARB_occlusion_query</kbd> and <kbd>#endif</kbd></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>GUI debugger in the works (28/03/2005)</h2>
    <p>If you're wondering what's been happening since the last release, here's the answer: I've been working on a GUI version of the debugger. A big advantage over the text based debugger will be a texture viewer. There may also be a viewer for buffers (e.g. depth buffer, stencil buffer), but that might take a bit longer. You can see what the debugger looks like so far in <a href="gldb-gui.png">this</a> screenshot.
    <h2>Email address fixed (23/02/2005)</h2>
    <p>The email address that my sourceforge address forwards to disappeared
    several months ago, and I forgot to update the forward. My apologies to
    anyone who has tried to reach me. Please try again now - it should now go
    to the right address (or wait until 24/02/2005, since Sourceforge says
    it may take up to 24 hours to effect the change). A general reminder:
    bugs, support requests etc. mail to
    bmerry &lt;at] users.sourceforge (dot) net.</p>
    <h2>Version 0.0.20050221 released (21/02/2005)</h2>
    <p>
    After three months of development, the shiny new version is ready. The state
    manager has been completely rewritten, and now works much better. 
    It also supports very nearly all of the OpenGL 2.0 state. You can download it from the Sourceforge <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/bugle/">project page</a>.
