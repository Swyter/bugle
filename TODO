Current:
--------
- check whether all dependencies on trackextensions are listed
- exploit per-context, per-filter state e.g. for video
- get threads working again in BSD

gldb
----
- allow Ctrl-C to abort current line when reading commands
- set filter variables on the fly
- ability to have filtersets loaded but inactive
- enable reporting of segfaults
- break on particular GL errors, not just 'all errors'

bugle
-----
- make segfault handling adhere better to POSIX
- rewrite some things to use hash tables
- autoconf test for GLENUM_IS_GLUINT
- cap and extension overrides
- better handling of texture proxies
- fill in the rest of the state (image state, mainly)
- handle GL shared and unshared objects correctly (queries unshared)
- improve support for GLSL (better code dump, more type information)
- capture more information about call lists
- capture and replay

budgie
------
- more autoconf tests (e.g. regex)
- robust logging, to avoid segfaulting
- move filter framework into budgie?

tests
-----
- multithreaded conformance tests
- coverage tests (glean?)
- tests for glut

long term
---------
- internationalisation
- Windows support
- graphical debugger interface
- write support for state
- network debugging
- better movie capture
  - option of a separate thread, for parallel encoding
