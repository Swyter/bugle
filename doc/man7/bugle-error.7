.TH error 7 "May 2007" BUGLE "User manual"
.SH NAME
error \- detect errors in OpenGL calls
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
filterset error
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This filter-set does not take any visible action on its own, but
provides a service to other filter-sets. It calls
.BR glGetError (3)
after every OpenGL call to detect OpenGL errors (it does not detect X
errors).

Usually you will not need to explicitly load this filter-set; if you
want to be informed of OpenGL errors, either use the
.B showerror
filterset, or
.BR gldb (1).
However, you may occasionally see the message
.IP
An OpenGL error was detected but will be lost to the app
.P
This means that
.BR bugle "'s"
internal error-checking code accidentally collected an error caused by
one of your calls, and thus if your application later called
.BR glGetError (3)
it would not be informed of the error. However, if you add the
.B error
filter-set, it will catch the error first and your application will be
correctly informed of the error.
.SH BUGS
Because the error reporting semantics of OpenGL are not completely
defined (in particular, an implementation may choose how many error
flags it has), it is impossible to guarantee that this filter-set is
completely transparent to the application. However, the first call to
.B glGetError (3)
after generating an error will always return an error, and in practice
this is all that is necessary.
