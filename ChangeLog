* Fix find_header.pl to look in . and in $srcdir
* Fix Perl warning in glexts.perl
* Have genfunctions.perl spit out #warnings in the C++ code when
  the function lists mismatch, rather than breaking everything
* Fix a check for the incorrect symbol in glstate.c (broke with
  older glext.h)

0.0.20050512
------------

  - GL_EXT_depth_bounds_test
  - GL_NV_texture_rectangle/GL_EXT_texture_rectangle/GL_ARB_texture_rectangle
  - GL_NV_light_max_exponent
  - GL_NV_depth_clamp
  - GL_NV_multisample_filter_hint
  - GL_NV_texture_expand_normal
  - GL_IBM_rasterpos_clip
* Add support for textures beyond GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS
  i.e. GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS and GL_MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS
* Add GL_COMPRESSED_TEXTURE_FORMATS to the state
* Extend the extension generator to handle extension groups
* Add some extra checks to the 'checks' filterset
* Add documentation on extension handling
* gldb no longer hangs when asked for non-existant substate

0.0.20050221
------------
* Added checks filterset
* Vastly improved support for systems short on extensions
* Changed the way tests are done (using regexes) to make them more
  robust and less likely to fail when moving to a different system.
* Redesign of the filter management code to reduce overhead.
* Redesign of the filter-set variable code to use tables rather than
  banks of if's.
* Rewrite some of the documentation.
* Rewrite of the code generator; now generates GROUP_ tokens and
  generally separates groups from functions.
* Rewrite of the state manager (incomplete).
* Support for GLSL.
* Rewritten object tracker, using radix trees.
* Linked lists and hash tables are now told at creation time whether
  they own their memory.
* Make opaque bugle_object and bugle_object_view typedefs.
* Redo the internals of object layer storage to avoid possible
  alignment problems.
* Added a threading abstraction layer.
* Removed canon.c/canon.h, since they are no longer needed.
* State now assembled by gldb, allowing tab completion for state
* Switch to ltdl for module and library loading

0.0.20041123
------------
* Added stats and showstats filtersets
* Speeded up the case where functions are not intercepted at all

0.0.20041108
------------
* Fix crash in video capture (not sure how it ever worked)
* Fix dumping bug (wrong field was being type overridden)
* (gldb) Make a blank line rerun previous command
* Fix various compiler warnings
* Added --without-lavc configure option
* Add the showextensions filter-set.

0.0.20041025
------------
* Redo libreadline detection to fall back gracefully if the library
  doesn't link properly, and to explicitly link against libncurses if
  present (needed for Slackware with readline 5, apparently)
* Better support for older versions of glext.h, as well as better support
  for possible future versions where extensions get promoted to core.
* Better dumping of GLSLang functions (GetUniformARB needs works still).
* Fix interception of glXGetProcAddressARB (was not loading the filter)

0.0.20041011
------------
* (gldb) Allow options to be passed to the program
* (gldb) screenshot command
* (gldb) Enable and disable filters on the fly
* (capture) By default, skip or duplicate frames for videos
* Fold old types.c and types.h into utils.c and utils.h
* Introduce names.c and names.h, to hold just the names of the functions
* Rewrite the token capture system, which now captures extension info
* New system to capture which functions belong to which extensions
* Support for per-context, per-filter state
* Move tracker library into the core source
* Move logging into the core source, and split the tracing functionality
  out into a 'trace' module
* Make gldb and libbugleutils independent of GL and X
* Hex output of GLXDrawable (looks nicer, plus removes spurious regression
  errors)

0.0.20040903
------------
* Improvements to video capture: get libavcodec to do the mirroring,
  and use GL_EXT_pixel_buffer_object for possibly faster capture.

0.0.20040719
------------
* Added ability to stop running program with Ctrl-C.
* Improved thread safety.
* Rewrite of the state code
* Added basic state dump support to gldb
* Dump overrides are now boolean expressions, not functions
* Improved test suite, with some log regression tests
* Support for aux contexts
* Added movie mode to screenshot filterset

0.0.20040614
------------
* Added the gldb debugger
* Added some sanity checks to make sure that internal code does not generate
  GL errors.
* Remove the "trap" option of the "error" module.
* Autoload the invoke filterset, and load the debugger filterset if the
  environment variables are set.
* Wrote manual pages.

0.0.20040609
------------
* Made lexer.ll more robust to headers containing function bodies and
  inline assembler.

0.0.20040608
------------
* First public release
