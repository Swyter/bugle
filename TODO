Current rewrite:
----------------
- exploit per-context, per-filter state e.g. for video
- update docs

gldb
----
- allow Ctrl-C to abort current line when reading commands
- make pushing enter in gldb rerun last command
- set filter variables on the fly
- enable reporting of segfaults
- print full dump of current function
- break on particular GL errors, not just 'all errors'
- better handling of state dumps (assemble on client side)
- tab completion for state

bugle
-----
- make segfault handling adhere better to POSIX
- rewrite some things to use hash tables
- autoconf test for GLENUM_IS_GLUINT
- use ltdl for loading modules
- cap and extension overrides
- fill in the rest of the state
- handle texture proxies
- handle GL shared objects correctly
- statistics and profiling
- capture information about call lists
- capture and replay
- better movie capture
  - option of a separate thread, for parallel encoding
  - --without-lavc configure option

budgie
------
- more autoconf tests (e.g. regex)
- robust logging, to avoid segfaulting
- move filter code into budgie?
- write support for state
- rewrite state code to parse C structs

tests
-----
- multithreaded conformance tests
- coverage tests
- tests for glut

general
-------
- more documentation
- allow the filter chain to be selectively bypassed, for benchmarking purposes

long term
---------
- internationalisation
- Windows support
- graphical debugger interface
- OpenGL 2.0 support
