Current:
--------
- check whether all dependencies on trackextensions are listed
- exploit per-context, per-filter state e.g. for video
- get threads working again in BSD (is this still broken?)

gldb
----
- allow Ctrl-C to abort current line when reading commands
- set filter variables on the fly
- enable reporting of segfaults
- break on particular GL errors, not just 'all errors'

gldb-gui
--------
- Show shader metadata in shader pane
- VBO decode
- convert state names to UTF8
- texture viewer:
  - texture zoom
  - show RGBA values
  - interaction with cube map cube
  - display of 3D textures
  - stats
  - options to control filtering etc
  - support for non-RGBA textures (e.g. shadow)
- test for extensions before using them, and query for extension
  addresses properly
- buffer window
- trace window?
- figure out why BadValue is sometimes generated on exit

bugle
-----
- handle use of GLX_SGIX_fbconfig rather than GLX 1.3 to manage contexts
- proper support for enabled but inactive filtersets
- make segfault handling adhere better to POSIX
- rewrite some things to use hash tables
- autoconf test for GLENUM_IS_GLUINT
- cap and extension overrides
- better handling of texture proxies
- fill in the rest of the state (image state, mainly)
- handle GL shared and unshared objects correctly (queries unshared)
- improve support for GLSL (more type information)
- capture more information about call lists
- capture and replay

budgie
------
- more autoconf tests (e.g. regex)
- robust logging, to avoid segfaulting
- move filter framework into budgie?

tests
-----
- multithreaded conformance tests
- coverage tests (glean?)
- autotool tests for glut

long term
---------
- internationalisation
- Windows support
- write support for state
- network debugging
- better movie capture
  - option of a separate thread, for parallel encoding
