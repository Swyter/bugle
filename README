Note; to build it on modern Linux you'll need some older version of gcc to generate the .tu file, I used the gcc-5 binary:
> CC=gcc5 scons parts=debugger
> CC=gcc5 scons parts=interceptor without_lavc=true # swy: skip the ffmpeg stuff
> CC=gcc5 scons parts=docs

Keep in mind that `CC=gcc5 scons parts=tests` seems to have circular dependencies, but we don't care about that one.

To debug the scons build `CC=gcc5 scons --debug=stacktrace` is useful.
