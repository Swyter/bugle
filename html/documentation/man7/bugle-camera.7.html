<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This filter-set allows you to take over the camera in an OpenGL
application and move it about. This is particularly useful for testing
visibility culling and level-of-detail (LOD), as these will
<I>not</I>

change as the camera is moved.
<P>
Since this filter-set is based on modifying OpenGL state without
telling the application, there are significant limitations:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The application may use a vertex program, provided that it uses the
camera transformation in the standard way.
<DT>*<DD>
The projection matrix, and in particular, the near and far clip planes,
are not altered. Thus, trying to move in too close or out too far could
cause objects to be clipped away.
<DT>*<DD>
Various fancy rendering techniques involve rendering a quad that is
carefully aligned to the screen; altering the camera will break such
techniques. There is ultimately no general fix as it is impossible to
know when an application is dealing with the real world. If you are
writing such an application and wish it to work with this filter-set,
you should use a vertex program that ignores the model-view matrix in
instances where you do not want this filter-set to interfere.
<DT>*<DD>
Applications that rely on the feedback buffer will likely break.
This filter-set supports activation and deactivation; the recommended
use is to have it initially inactive and use a key to take over control
when desired.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>mouse_dga</B>

<DD>
This is a boolean option which should be enabled when debugging an
application that uses the
<B><A HREF="../man3/XDGA.3.html">XDGA</A></B>(3)

extension to get relative motion data from the mouse. If the camera
goes all over the place as soon as you move the mouse, try enabling
this option (SDL-based applications are the main culprits).
<DT><B>speed</B>

<DD>
This sets the speed at which the camera moves. Since each application
has a different scale, you will need to adjust the value for each
application (but dynamic control is also possible; see below).
<DT><B>key_forward</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>key_back</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>key_left</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>key_right</B>

<DD>
The are the keys for moving the camera. They default to the arrow
keys.
<DT><B>key_faster</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>key_slower</B>

<DD>
These keys control the speed of the camera, doubling or halving it
respectively. They default to PageUp and PageDown.
<DT><B>key_reset</B>

<DD>
This key cancels any alterations made, restoring the camera to where
the application thinks it is. There is no default.
<DT><B>key_toggle</B>

<DD>
This key alternately releases and recaptures the mouse. It can be
useful if you need to use the mouse in another window without
completely disabling the filter-set (which would also restore the
camera position). There is no default.
<DT><B>key_frustum</B>

<DD>
This toggles display of the original view frustum. If this driver
supports
<B>GL_NV_depth_clamp</B>,

depth clamping is used to prevent the frustum from being clipped to the
near and far clip planes. There is no default.
